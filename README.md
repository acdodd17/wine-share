# Wine Share

## About Our Product
Our app, Wine Share, is a virtual wine cellar. This app allows for the consumer to not only keep track of what wines they have, but also provide them with the source of where the wine came from. Wine Share allows for the consumer to keep track of the vintage, type of wine, quantity of bottles, and the source for the wine. This app also provides the consumer the ability to upload a picture of the bottle as well. The consumer will never have to wonder where they got their wine in case they want to buy more. Wine Share allows for users to be able to see other users' cellars as well.

## Purpose
Wine Share is virtual wine cellar app with the ability to track specific details about the user's specific wine bottles. We used Handlebars, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Node.js, Express, and MySQL to create this website. We started with a basic wireframe to create the layout of the website. We used the wireframe along with Handlebars, Bootstrap, and CSS to create the basic HTML outline for our website. After using Handlebars, Bootstrap, and CSS to format the HTML, we started to code the JavaScript, Node.Js, and Express.js, which we used to create a RESTful API. Additionally, we have added the function of a database using MySQL and Sequelize ORM, so that the consumer can always come back and look at their cellar.
